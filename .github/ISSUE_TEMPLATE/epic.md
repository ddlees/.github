## RICE Prioritization Score

**Reach:**
<!-- What percentage of people will this benefit over a month? -->
<!-- (0 - 100) - Don’t get hung up on time units; Do a conversion if necessary -->

**Impact:**
<!-- What is the average impact this will make on your target audience? -->
<!-- (Massive = 3, High = 2, Medium = 1, Low = 0.5, Minimal = 0.25) -->

**Confidence:**
<!-- How confident are you in your estimates for Reach and Impact? -->
<!-- (High = 100) - "I have tons of data to back my estimates!" -->
<!-- (Medium = 80) - "My dataset is mostly complete but I have a hole here and there" -->
<!-- (Low = 50) - "I did just enough research to justify " -->

**Effort:**
<!-- Roughly, what is the total number of “person-sprints” will this take? -->
<!-- (min. 0.5) Don’t get into the weeds of estimation; The team will do a real sizing. -->
<!-- e.g. - 1 engineer & 1 designer for 0.5 sprints = 1 "person-sprints" -->
<!-- e.g. - 1 engineer for 2 sprints = 2 "person-sprints" -->

**Prioritization Score:**
<!-- (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort = Score -->
