<!-- INVEST time in writing your stories -->
<!--
A good user story should be:

- Independent - Stories should have as few dependencies on other stories as possible
- Negotiable - Omit requirements that would prevent completion of the story in a single iteration
- Valuable - Implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable and useful to the target audience
- Estimate-able - Implementors should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories in story points
- Sizable - Implementation should fit in one iteration; otherwise, it is an EPIC
- Testable - A targeted user must be able to check the conditions and status of the acceptance criteria
